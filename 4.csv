"Darul Sehat Hospital and a Medical college in Gulistan e Jauhar , Block - 15 , Karachi is serving the people for quite some time . Their medical facilities are normal but charges are higher. They need to give proper training to all the Medical and non Medical staff ."
"Darul Sehat build a new trauma & emergency area and they increase opd charges the old charges is 550 and now 750 and service charges 300. Every one there, are just ready to just loot you through different ways. If you are in extreme É??"
A great place for all kinds of medical and dental services. 24 hr emergency is also dealt alongwith dedicated covid vaccination centre É??
"Darul Sehat hospital is a private hospital which is looking the poor patients. Every one there, are just ready to just loot you through different ways. If you are in extreme emergency, then visit this hospital only, otherwise go to some É??"
This hospital has a very slow service and unskilled workers. This place takes so much time to discharge the patient. I truly would not recommend this hospital to anyone.
This is one of the worst hospital uses expired medicines and injections. THEY KILLED OUR RELATIVE. They donot have any remorse I sugest people to burn it down.
A very well maintained hospital all doctors and nursing staff are highly qualified and very much corporative and newly built emergency department was Soo good ???ç É??
"The Dentistry department of Darul Sehat is cheap as compare to private dentists. You can save upto 50% on special packages (on announced days only). In the prevailing situation of Covid-19, doctors and other staff played an important role maintaining social distances within the hospital premises."
Unlike many other hospitals they will provide good services at an average cost . The hospital is well built with competitive staff matched with well educated surgeons. É??
"The hospital is okay. Always had to consult some other hospital and doctor after visiting Darul sehat. Don't know why, but can't get satisfaction."















Darul sehat hospital in johar has average environment for patients. Their sevice is ok as of now. They need to work on their service delivery. As compare to agha khan and liaqat it is about 60 percent as compared to their equipments and services.
"poor service,i had a oppointment to DR SABEKA RAZA AT 10 AM.ALL PATIENTS ALONG WITH ME WAIT FOR 1 HOUR BUT STILL SHE IS NOT THERE ON HER OPD ON TIME.HER OPD TIMING IS 10 AM T 2 PM.staff always giving blame excuses that she is coming,she is coming before 1hour but she is still not there....."
I had an ortho surgery through panel. Dr verbally prescribed a bed rest of 6 weeks. after 3 weeks when i requested for the written bed rest prescription then they start denying giving any such document which i needed for submission at my É??
"It was my first visit to the Hospital after nearly ten years. Well, it has certainly improved its standards new building new deprtments and new equipments."
This hospital charges massive amount of money from the patients but looking at the hygiene condition of their toilet is embarrassing! É??
Its not darul sehat its darul maut going in this hospital means your general patient in ventilator. Please don't go here save your family ???è É??
"Butcher hospital, butcher doctors, unethical practices and the most pathetic conduct of labor room, they are truly criminals, instead of giving hope to patients, they make their delivery experience extremely traumatized, I will never É??"
Never visit this horribly expensive hospital. Doctors are very unprofessional. All they care about is money not patient's health and well being. This hospital offers expensive treatment which most of the patients cannot afford.
"Infrastructure and services are average
Treatment services are horrible.
Have had several experiences of poor case management.
Would certainly not recommend for Inpatient treatment."
Documents department Mr Naseem very disappointed he work in private hospital like Jinnah n civil hospital or work like civic center. Front of me he wrong guide two person including me. He is very irresponsible person like this type of bad É??
this hospital plase a key possision in johar very easy to go there but problem is that it is very coustly and service charjes is too much
Staff mursaleen very good and handsome and doing good job very very good guy.
"Darul Sehat Hospital is a 250-bed tertiary care teaching hospital located in Gulistan-e-Jauhar, Karachi. The hospital is affiliated with Liaquat College of Medicine & Dentistry. The hospital is well-equipped with the latest technology and É??"
"Dr Shahid Ahmed the so called gastroenterologist in Darul sehat hospital is such a worst doctor ever he is not a doctor, such a bloody theif, May Allah give him worst punishment in this world and after die"
"This is the worst Hospital that I have ever seen in my life. No proper services offered by this hospital.
My mother was passed away in this hospital and it was somehow negligence of the É??"
This is a 3rd class hospital with highly unprofessional staff and doctors. Even the hospital's female washroom at ground floor was not functional for symbols mother whom I took for orthopedic checkup of her knees. The doctor due on 830 did É??
"Does not deserve any start as doctors are more worse than expected, perhaps good for very basic treatment and  right to say killers. Liaquat hospital is the best choice all the way"
"Very good reputation.
Suitable for nearby patient.
Charges are reasonable as compare to other big hospitals. É??"
Worst and pathetic hospital. Killer hospital. Due to their negligence a precious life was lost. The medicine team blames surgery team and surgery team blames the medicine team. A person who went for a minor operation ended up losing his life. They dont care about a person's life.
"I found this is one the best hospitals in Karachi. It is a big hospital with very economical rates. Staff is well trained, departments are well equipped. Doctors are also experienced. I wish them best of luck with prayers may Allah bless them with same excellent and economical services to the patients."
"Wort hospital in my life, only good for basic services like getting pressure checked, ECG and nebulized. It's okay to earn but not okay to fleece the patients. Rude staff. Only good to take a dead body for ease in obtaining death certificate."
Third class hospital and third class people. Their reports always differ from other hospitals. Either they are correct and all others are wrong..?? Impossible.! É??
Very bad ever hospital in the world..worst ever hospital..they use trainee to do experiments on the patients..very careless staff and doctors..poor service they want every patient to die..people go there for tretment and comes out with their dead bodies of their bleoved..higly non recomended hospital..worst and dead hospital .
You can have physician from nearly every field. They have well equipped dentistry. Rooms are well maintained and service is reasonably good. 24 hour emergency adds value to this hospital.
Housekeeping staff are very impressive hospital is neat and clean .Nursing Staff and the OPD Staff is very supportive and they make it possible to deliver at your own with moral support. Only the waiting areas need to be improved. É??
"Was extremely disappointed with the manager staff, lot of attitude and ego problems for just questioning their systems. Went for vaccination purposes but the hospital was not following any proper SOP. Patients were being treated in risky É??"
"Lab charges too much high, today i visit the hospital for insulin test they ask me 3550/ and c-peptide test rates 4950/ then i visit dow lab there insulin test charge only 950/ and c-peptide charges 2500/. ..... Kuch to sharm aani chaheye.....kya ye dow se bhi bara hospital he....i hate ...you can check it if i am rong.."
"Hospital services for patients are better than others hospitals. Comparatively cost efficient than other. Cleanliness needs more attention. Behavior of medical staff is good. Well ventilated, well built and vast built building."
"It is highly appreciated for me being as a patient in this healthcare. This organization is the best healthcare for middle class people. The protocol, services, consultant and emergency is  best in this Hospital. My experience is excellent in this Hospital. Allah bless this organization and the staff who is working 24/7."
Thank you for your kind hospitality.
"A good hospital with all the services. Not expensive, but neither inexpensive. Great services and doctors, but parking issues. Very responsive emergency ward. I personally never observed or received any problems from this institute/hospital."
I am very sorry to say that the canteen behind the pharmacy that is located in the parking of darul sehat hospital is having a very cheap kind of employee there . I have asked him for a bottle of water . He ignored me and keep playing games É??
other than OPD if some one getting admission in this hospital he/she must be aware of their payment method which is totally unrealistic un ethical. after getting Advance payment they pin relatives or attendant even in mid of the night to pay for additional amount. they are running a business.
"Third class hospital and third class people.
They did a wrong ultrasound and informed me that my wife had already miscarriage. Dr. Gave her an abortion tablet. We are were not satisfied so we visited É??"
"DSH is one of its kinds. I found them very organized and disciplined.
Outstanding addition in health facilities for the masses and especially for people who are not able to bear burdened of healthcare nowadays. Premises are open spacious, good in terms of air and sunshine. All major facilities are accessible"
"Good  Doctors team! I have been seen, who's been very thorough and made the whole experience pleasant. All the staff is really helpful, it doesn't even feel like you're in a hospital in the traditional sense"
"Unfortunately, we don't have surveillance (Monitoring) system. I had worked in hospital around eight years I personally observed that top management only needs money by hook or by crook. É??"
"Well managed hospital with good doctors,
I highly recommended Darul Sehat hospital because they are providing quality treatment. Additionally, their management is outstanding and doctors are amazing. And I believe not just medication is work wonderfully; care and spoken words can do miracles."
"Since 11 in the morning to 12 afternoon I have been calling
Jinnah Cardio
Patel Hospital É??"
The Gynae and Ob OPD fee was 800 brfore July and it has all of sudden increased to 1200 God knows why! So I have changed my review as things have improved since my first visit. The doctor has been extremely cooperative and listens and É??
"The quite satisfying experience the staff member are very cooperative, i have visited yesterday for my lab reports there was a problem with my slip regarding cash counter, they helped and cooperated with me which was very appreciative. I just wanna thanks the staff for being so humble and cooperative. Thank ew Darul-Sehat hospital."
I have always observed standard protocols here. The ambience is neat & clean with state of the art services especially in operation theatre & accident & emergency Dept which are fully equipped and are with highly qualified skilled É??
"Doctors are fake here as I remember going into the emergency when I was unwell.
The doctor had given an incorrect prescription and to be honest I knew he was fake. É??"
"This hospital is very controversial....seen some bad cases from here.... although their corona handling is much better than others... Dr Rashid Naseem is the lead of Covid-19 team, recommended. É??"
Overall it was a good hospital they have emergency services they have never department they havecardiac renal and many other units they also have ICU services which includes a stew and critical unit care doctors were there were pretty much cooperative
Unlicensed hospital and Untrained and Irresponsible staff - Please boycott them if you want patient to stay alive. They murdered  Nishwa and many more. Also shame on people who are adding fake positive comments for this hospital even after what they did to little angel Nashwa.
"I have visited this hospital so many times, staff are caring, helpful & supportive and this is the place, where i can find majority of the clinical services. they are also providing Covid- 19 services which are far better than other hospitals in the area."
"My personal experience in darul sehat hospital as a patient was execllent , nursing staff were quite cooperative and caring also cleanliness was very good , i found darul sehat hospital to be cost effective with high quality medical and nursing care."
"Hospital was very best and clean all facilities are available but.......
Doctors forced to admit your patient even patient can't need to admission
Lab charges are also little high than others É??"
"Nice hospital with professional well qualified staff, polite behavior centrally air conditioned building . Charges are less than Patel & Aga Khan. Regarding the death of little girl I could say that Death is in Allah's hand ."
"due to wrong injection a 9 month baby lost its life, and now they are campaigning on social media (and keeping only favorable comments) trying to paint the father of victim in bad light. Its not even a registered hospital as per claims nor the administration is clear about it. I would stay away from it"
Hospital is over all good.Cleanliness and maintenance needs improvement.It is good for OPD.They have a seperate dental clinic too.Emergency department is not spacious and needs improvement.They have well maintained elevators.Parking is a É??
"Not the good experience, rather than to provide best services more focused on making money. my all pictures are ........."
"The most highlighted is the comprehensive high tech facilities under a single umbrella, that really gives the patient a comfort zone, and undoubtly the covid ward is the revolutionary step towards corporate responsibility for the nearby É??"
"Will never recommend any one to visit darul sehat. It's juz like a tuk shop. Without properly considering my father's case, they put him in ICU to observe. He was absolutely fine just had a gastro issue. Unbelievable.  Emergency ward staff always dieing to admit. Bus murga hathey lagey jaye. Always be aware of them"
"Darul Sehat Hospital is providing  best services, neat & clean all facilities are available. Lab charges are also economical than others Hospital"
"I would like to thank Dr together with all the staff involved and Good Hope hospital for their professional competent and committed approach they deliver at all times, making me and other patients feel at ease during these anxious times. Many thank again."
"Now a days health and education sector is become a highly profitable business in Pakistan and darul sehat hospital and medical college is a perfect example of that.  Worst medical facilities, inexperienced doctors and paramedics. Worst É??"
Some of the doctors are really good in their area of specialization. Nursing staff is not enough careful about in patients needs. Hospital does not have proper disclosure about patient's case and treatment record.
very good hospital good services good patient care thumbs up .
it is a very helpful place and satisfy with this orginazation even also staff have a good communication skills and many more objectives they have i recomanded this for my nebour's and friends for Darul-ul-sehat hospital.
Nice hospital but the staff are irresponsible and misbehaving
"In Darul Sehat Hospital, doctors are killers, murders and are not there to save lives of people but to loot them, to make money and then kill them, they charge money even after the patient is expired by ventilating them and charge up to 15 É??"
"I wont prefer this hospital if you have another choice. Rude staff, doctors are not polite & gentle, adminstration need money so they raise opd charges upto 40%. Few doctors are good ... better ask the doctor of his other hospital address & É??"
"Okay so first of all, I'm a not at all surprised at the level of inexperience your staff has after my today's unpleasant experience in your laboratory, well, thats because it has happened before. I've already told you the details at the É??"
It's private hospital at Johar Chorangi Karachi. This is big private hospital in surrounding. It provides 24 hours services. It has dispensary also. It has emergency department also. This provides adults as well as children medical facility. Now a days it's famous as Daral Moat.
Wouldn't recommend anyone rushing to this morgue which call itself hospital. They have a history of messing up cases of patients.
They charge you like any other quality hospital and provide services with untrained staff and useless doctors. I visited many times there as it is the closest hospital around but services are really poor.
"Good ER services where immediate required actions are taken. Very good consultants are present om OPD basis. A little bit expensive for sure but them facilities too are provided. Covers a big population of Jauhar,  Gulshan,  Safura Goth, Pehlwan goth and Dalmia."
If you want your loved ones to suffer than visit this place. Staff is untrained and hospital is operating without a license. They are murdrers. May the responsible rot in hell. É??
"One of the best hospitals I've ever visited.
Staff is very cooperative. Management is much maintained."
"Private room has too many coacroches , nurses staff has bad behavior specially night shift. All the staff treat you like charity hospital"
"Pathetic Hospital Should Be Banned.

Pathetic most Pathetic and Uneducated Staff. É??"
Hospital is well but My request head of hospital please need to improve adminstrative and management side
Very bad emergency and opd. A patient of acute kidney failure symptoms visited them two times a day under mild condition but these rascals could not diagnose the ailment. It was grossly unfortunate for us to rush him to these plunderers again only because of emergency at midnight and it's location being very near. But alas! we lost.
"worst hospital in the world. opd boht achi hai but opd counter is worst or ghalti se b yaha kabhi admit na hona or emergency me to bilkul b nahe, ghatiya tareen staff or facility and also language. icu me staff ka shor, hospital just need only money."

"We received best care at the Darul Sehat Hospital, Nursing staff that cared for my aunt were outstanding, and the Doctor was also lovely. Thanks a million"
"Average standard hospital in the vicinity, good for local population"
It has been reportes that the registration of the hospital had been rescinded by the government due to medical malpractise and a number of undortunate incidences due to incompetent staff. Avoid even in case of emergencies.
Its a good hospital There is an emergency room 24 hrs open and all specialist doctor here i suggest doctor Rashid Naseem for blood pressure and sugar specialist he is grate doctor.
"I visit this hospital, provide good faculties, give better treatment to the patient and has well behaved nursing staff, keep it up???ç É??"
Darul sehat hospital is well organized and healthy competent hospital where there is 100% patient care along with highly cooperative staff and doctors behavior.
Average hospital with average services. Infrastructure is not good. My friend was admitted in semiprivate ward after getting fractures and i found that bathroom of that room was almost one foot upper. É??
This is a reasonably big hospital but its standard is very low. Quality of care is simply hopeless. OPD too is very below average
You were all truly amazing  for my family  that you cared for we couldnÉ??t have done it without you all thank you so much Darul sehat hospital staff.
You can't trust on any one in this facilities ... Bills and other staffs have no answers if you ask about bills and test results ... People those are part of this institution blames each other... So be careful

Medium standard health facility. Car parking issues. Traffic jams in surroundings. A dental & medical college also run here which sounds like an ugly joke. I don't know what kind of medical graduates this set up can  produce.
Good facilities for medical care

They donot ask you anything just do the checkup and leave
Nursing staff is very hardworking"

If you want to take revenge from someone send them to this hospital."
