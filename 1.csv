"Best place with quality services, one window for all the problems. doctors are very professional , and the environment is best..
price are higher then any other hospital but if you see the facility and all other things, i think price doesn't matter.
if you have a chance to meet financial councilor, they are the devils of AKU, so nothing to take on heart.
i have very good experience while i was with my father treatment here. both indoor and outdoor. i will suggest if you want the best treatment you are in the best place. ??"
Just another money making machine. My son had a deep cut so I took him to emergency where Dr said it will be minor surgery thats needs to be done so I will have to admit him for a day. ?
